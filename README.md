# Pig-game
A javascript game that used the DOM manipulation. Both players are rolling a dice to gain points in order to reach the winning score. 
A player can keep rolling the dice and add the dice number to their current score, which can be added to their total score when they press the hold button.
However, they will lose all the current scores if they roll one, and they will be switched to the other player's turn. When the hold button is pressed, the current player's
turn will end as well. The first player who reaches a total score of 100 wins the game.
